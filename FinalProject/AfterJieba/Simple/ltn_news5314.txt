IMPROVED   ENFORCEMENT :   The   period   during   which   the   government   officials   would   be   subject   to   regulation   after   leaving   office   would   depend   on   their   influence

 Eighteen   categories   of   government   officials ,   including   the   president   and   vice   president ,   would   be   subjected   to   strict   regulations   against   money   laundering   to   ensure   financial   transparency   and   stability ,   according   to   a   draft   act   prepared   by   the   Ministry   of   Justice . 
 An   amendment   to   the   Money   Laundering   Control   Act   （ 洗钱 防 制法 ） ,   which   was   approved   last   year   and   is   to   take   effect   on   June   28 ,   stipulates   that   financial   institutions   and   certain   non - financial   agencies   must   improve   their   review   of   clients   who   hold   key   political   offices ,   as   well   as   their   relatives   and   close   associates ,   to   assess   and   manage   the   risk   of   money   laundering . 
 Transaction   records   of   the   people   covered   by   the   act   must   be   preserved ,   according   to   the   amendment . 
 The   ministry ,   which   has   prepared   bills   pertaining   to   the   amendment   following   discussions   with   the   financial   sector ,   yesterday   announced   a   draft   act   to   determine   the   government   officials   who   would   be   subjected   to   stringent   financial   vetting   process . 
 The   draft   act   stipulates   improved   enforcement   of   money   laundering   laws   for   the   president   and   vice   president ;   legislators ;   mayors ;   county   commissioners ;   council   speakers ;   ministers ;   directors   of   political   parties ;   Presidential   Office   and   National   Security   Council   secretaries - general   and   their   deputies ;   the   Academia   Sinica   president   and   vice   president ;   presidents ,   vice   presidents ,   secretaries - general   and   deputy   secretaries - general   of   the   Executive   Yuan ,   Legislative   Yuan ,   Judicial   Yuan ,   Control   Yuan   and   Examination   Yuan ;   members   of   the   Examination   Yuan   and   Control   Yuan ;   justices   and   the   chief   justice   of   the   Supreme   Court   and   the   Supreme   Administrative   Court ;   ambassadors   and   diplomatic   representatives ;   directors   of   military   units   ranking   lieutenant   general   or   higher ;   and   directors   and   general   managers   of   state - run   businesses . 
 The   ministry   can   also   put   officials   tasked   with   the   fulfillment   of   major   public   policies   or   the   management   of   national   or   public   assets   of   sizeable   financial   value ,   under   regulation ,   according   to   the   draft   act . 
 Relatives   of   key   officials   to   be   regulated   include   their   parents ,   children ,   siblings ,   spouses   and   their   siblings ,   or   partners   living   with   them . 
 Close   associates   of   key   officials   include   their   employers   or   employees ,   business   partners ,   people   having   close   business   ties   with   the   officials   and   directors   of   the   organizations   or   unions   of   which   the   officials   are   members . 
 The   duration   during   which   the   government   officials   would   be   subject   to   regulation   after   they   leave   office   would   depend   on   their   influence ,   which   is   judged   by   the   time   they   were   in   office   and   the   connection   between   their   former   positions   and   future   positions ,   according   to   the   draft   act . 
 If   it   is   judged   that   a   retired   official   should   be   placed   under   regulation ,   their   relatives   and   close   associates   would   also   to   be   regulated ,   the   draft   act   stipulates . 
 Tightened   control   on   the   financial   activities   of   key   government   officials   is   not   expected   to   discourage   the   private   sector   from   hiring   retired   officials   as   company   directors   or   independent   directors ,   although   their   employment   would   subject   the   company   to   stricter   regulation   against   money   laundering ,   the   ministry   said .
