When a German woman found a wallet containing 1,000 euros （$1,220） she decided it was better to get a reward from the owner than to keep the money -- even if that meant resorting to extortion, police said.
當一名德國婦女發現一個錢包裡裝有1,000 歐元（1,220美元）時，她決定上策是向失主討賞，而非吞下拾金—儘管這意味要訴諸強索手段，警方說。
"It was a bit stupid. She could just have kept the wallet," said a spokeswoman for police in the southwestern city of Darmstadt. "But she wanted the finder’s reward -- and might have got one anyway. But she opted to extort it instead."
「這有一點蠢。她可以逕自留住這個錢包，」西南部城市達慕士塔警局一名女發言人說。「但她想得到拾金者的賞金—其實無論如何都應該拿得到。她卻選擇用強索方式。」
Police said the 47-year-old woman found the owner’s phone number in the wallet and told the pensioner she could only have it back for 100 euros "plus 20 euros travel costs".
警方說，這名47歲的婦女在錢包中發現失主的手機號碼，而且告訴這名退休老人，她要拿回錢包，就必須付100歐元，「外加20歐元的旅費」。
The owner agreed to the terms, and tipped off police, who arrested the woman with the wallet at the handover point.
這名物主同意這些條件，而且向警方報案，警方也在交貨地點人贓俱獲逮捕到這名婦女。
